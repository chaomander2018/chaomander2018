My team and I built these two comphrehensive packages for image filtering purpose. 

Please refer to my two packages:
[filterizeR](https://github.com/chaomander2018/filterizeR-1)
[filterizePy](https://github.com/chaomander2018/filterizePy)

### Overview

This is a Collaborative Software Development Project in which we will be working on three image processing filters using convolutions.

### Functions

- #### Green Color Filter `greenscale()`
This green color filter converts the original image to a green scaled image.
Please see the original image and processed image below.

- #### Sharpen Filter `sharpen_image()`
This sharpen filter highlights edges and fine details in an image.

- #### Mirror Filter `mirror()`
This mirror filter function will use convolution to convert the original image to a mirrored image i.e. the left side of the image will be transformed into the right side and the right side of the original image will be transformed into the left side.
